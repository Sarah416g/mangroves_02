         Thriving mangroves are key to the health of nature and effective climate action.
        Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) is an online platform that provides the remote sensing data and tools for monitoring mangroves necessary for this.
         It gives universal access to near real-time information on where and what changes there are to mangroves across the world, and highlights why they are valuable.

        With hi-res information on topography, soil conditions and hydrology, Global Mangrove Watch gives coastal and park managers, conservationists, policymakers and
        practitioners the evidence needed to respond to illegal logging, pinpoint the causes of local mangrove loss and track restoration progress.
        It is a tool that can help mangroves be central to climate mitigation, adaptation and sustainable development plans and policies. ~ Global Mangrove Watch
